# Social Loafing (Part-1)

Maximilian Ringelmann, a French engineer, studied the performance of horses 🐎 🐎 in 1913. 

He concluded that the power of two animals pulling a coach did not equal twice the power of a single horse.

Surprised by this result, he extended his research to humans. 

He had several men 👬 pull a rope 🪢 and measured the force applied by each individual.

On average, if two people were pulling together, each invested just 93 percent of his individual strength, when three pulled together, it was 85 percent, and with eight people, just 49 percent.

Science calls this the "Social loafing" effect. It occours when individual performance is not directly visible; it blends into the group effort.

It occurs among rowers, but not in relay races, because here, individual contributions are evident. "Social loafing" is rational behaviour.

Why invest all of your energy when half will do? especially when this little shortcut goes unnoticed?

Quite simply, social loafing is a form of cheating of which we are all guilty even if it takes place unconsciously, just as it does with the horses.

When people work together, individual performances decrease. This isn't surprising. What is note worty, however, is that our input doesn't grind to a complete halt ‼️ 

So, what stops us from putting our feet up and letting the others do the hard work? 

The consequences. Zero performance would be noticed and it brings with it weighty punishments, such as exlusion from the group or villification.

Evolution has led us to develop many fine-tuned senses, including how much idleness we can get away with and how to recognize it in others.

Social loafing doesn't occour solely in physical performance. 

We slack off mentally, too. For example, in meetings, the larger the team, the weaker our individual participation.

However, once a certain number of participants are involved, our performance plateaus. Whether the group consists of twenty or one hundred people is not important-- Maximum inertia has been achieved.

Next time when you are in a meeting if some one say, can you come again please? or I missed that part, can you please repeat? 🙂 . You know you are in the matrix of "Social loafing".

With this context now re-collect the posts you read about Jeff Bezos or Elon musk keeping the number of participants limited to 1 pizza size in a meeting are all talking about the same concept called "Social Loafing"

But one question remains: ❓ 
Who came up with the much vaunted idea that teams achive more than individual workers? 

I've been the victim of this "8 people team" all my life. Did me or my team underperformed? Did I not use my team 100 percent efficiency? 


Let us decode this more in detail in my next post...

# Social Loafing (Part-2)

We will pick it from where we left in my previous post!

Who came up with the much vaunted idea that teams achieve more than individual workers? 

In my opinion maybe the Japanese.🇯🇵 

Forty years ago, they flooded global markets with their products. 

Business economists looked more closely at the industrial miracle and saw that Japanese factories were organized into teams. 

If you have ever heard of "Kaizen", "sprint" , "agile", “Lean” philosophies are all in one or the other form were derived from Japanese culture. 

This model was a great success when it came to large factories such as automotive and helped Japanese car manufacturers to have a strong foothold in US market.

But some other industries such as Banking🏦, Chemical ⚗️or Oil refineries🛢️ this model was not so successful. Over all we can safely assume and say, this model was copied-with mixed success.

What worked very well in Japan could not be replicated with the Americans, Europeans and other Asians. 

Teams function better if and only if they are small and consist of diverse, specialized people. This makes sense, because within such groups, individual performances can be traced back to each specialist.

This was also specifically true with the teams, where I was part of in my previous organizations. 

Even though we worked in a team, there was a specific responsibility for each team member and the success or failure of tasks and project could be easily traced back to that individuals.

It is very important to understand here that "Traceability" 📈and "Accountability" 🧾 are certainly the most important things to keep in mind 🧠when we are operating in a team to avoid this problem of "Social Loafing" within the teams.

On the other hand, Social loafing has interesting implications.

In groups, we tend to hold back not only in terms of participation but also in terms of accountability. 

Nobody wants to take the rap for the misdeeds or poor decisions of the whole group. 

We hide behind the team decisions. The technical term for this “diffusion of responsibility”. 
For the same reason, teams tend to take bigger risks than their members would take on their own. 

The individual group members reason that they are not the only ones who will be blamed if things go wrong. 

Here is one familiar example. 

While planning as a group we tend to underestimate the complexity of tasks and over commit. But when it comes to estimating the story points for our task, we tend to be very stingy? (sounds familiar? been there done that! 😉)

This effect is called “risky shift” and is especially hazardous Among company and pension-fund strategists, where billions are at stake or in the Defense Department, where groups decide on the use of nuclear weapons.

In conclusion, people behave differently in groups than when alone.

The disadvantages of groups can be mitigated by making individual performance as visible as possible.

But what to measure? how to measure?

If Maximilian Ringelmann evaluates my 8 people team, is he going to identfy the efficiency as 49 percent?
